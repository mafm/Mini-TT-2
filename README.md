Mini-TT
=======

OCaml reimplementation of the language described in the article [_A simple
type-theoretic language:
Mini-TT_](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~bengt/papers/GKminiTT.pdf) by Coquand,
Yoshiki, Bengt and Makoto. I translated the [original
code](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/logic/Mini-TT/) to OCaml because
I tend to understand better when I write and OCaml is easier for me to read.
